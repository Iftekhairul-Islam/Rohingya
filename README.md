# Rohingya
The Rohingya genocide in Myanmar has put more than a million Rohingyas out of their motherland. Bangladesh, being the closest neighbor, has to offer shelter and other sustenance for them. Being a small country in terms of landmass, Bangladesh has been facing massive difficulty to accommodate this sudden influx of people. The government has been trying its best to tackle the situation. Still, the country is suffering due to the profound negative impact the refugees are making on the local socio-economic fabric. Environmental loss is also irreparable.
I have come up with a GIF made of timelapse satellite images to show how the landscape in and around the refugee camp, where more 800,000 people are living, change in just two years.
